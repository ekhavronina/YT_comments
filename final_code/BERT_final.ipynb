The only thing is that if you have a very specific error condition that would otherwise be time consuming to write out in if statements, and you know the inside code is fine except for that error condition, then I think it saves time as long as that block is not taking in any unexpected input. Like I had a case where 3 variables were iterated and the function divided 1/the variables, so for the case that they all =0 it would have thrown an error, and otherwise I would have to write an if statement for all 3 variables and the program would have to check it on each loop, otherwise using the try/except it worked fine. I'm not a great coder so if anyone has a better way to write something like this let me know, but in this specific situation it ran faster. I found that using the try/except block saved 1.3% on time vs an if statement checking that all 3 variables weren't simultaneously 0.\",\n",
